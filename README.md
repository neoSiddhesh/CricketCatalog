# CricketCatalog

**Cricket Catalog** is an iOS app that displays a list of the top 5 cricket nation teams. The project is built using **Swift** and contains two branches, each demonstrating a different UI framework:

- `CricketCatalogUIKit` branch: Uses UIKit for the user interface.
- `CricketCatalogSwiftUI` branch: Uses SwiftUI for the user interface.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following branches:

### 1. `CricketCatalogUIKit` Branch

- Implements the user interface using **UIKit**, Apple's traditional framework for building iOS apps.
- Uses components like `UITableView`, `UIViewController`, `UIView`, and `UISearchBar` to display the top 5 cricket teams in a list format using MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.

### 2. `CricketCatalogSwiftUI` Branch

- Implements the user interface using **SwiftUI**, Apple's declarative UI framework.
- Makes use of `VStack`, `ScrollView`, `TabView`, and other SwiftUI views to display the list of cricket teams.
- Demonstrates the simplicity and flexibility of SwiftUI for building dynamic UIs using of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.
