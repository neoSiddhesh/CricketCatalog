## Overview

Cricket Catalog provides an interactive list of the top 5 cricket teams, with a focus on ease of use and visual appeal. The project is split into two branches, each illustrating a different UI framework for iOS development:

- The `CricketCatalogUIKit` branch uses the **UIKit** framework, showcasing Apple's traditional way of building user interfaces.
- The `CricketCatalogSwiftUI` branch adopts **SwiftUI**, Apple's modern, declarative framework, which is simpler and more flexible.

Both implementations follow the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern, ensuring a clean separation between the UI and business logic, making the project scalable and maintainable.
